\title{Extract variant information from an alignment}
\usage{
extract_variant(
  alignment,
  variant_name,
  match_pattern,
  reference_seq_index = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alignment}{A DNAStringSet object containing the aligned sequences}

\item{variant_name}{Character string with the name of the variant (e.g., "I211V")}

\item{match_pattern}{Character string with the nucleotide pattern to locate the variant}

\item{reference_seq_index}{Integer index of the reference sequence (default: 1)}
}
\value{
A factor with the nucleotide at the variant position for each sequence
}
\description{
Extract variant information from an alignment
}
\details{
This function locates a specific variant in a sequence alignment and extracts
the nucleotide at that position for each sequence. It uses a pattern matching
approach to identify the exact position of the variant.
