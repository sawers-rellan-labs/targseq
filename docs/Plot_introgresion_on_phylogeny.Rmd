This tutorial walks through a complete workflow for processing maize genetic data, focusing on:

1. Relabeling sequence identifiers in a FASTA alignment with meaningful taxonomic labels
2. Extracting genotype information at multiple variant positions (I211V and A204T)
3. Creating a phylogenetic tree with ancestry and variant information
4. Rotating the tree to position the B73 reference genome at the top

## 1. Setting up the Environment

First, let's install and load the necessary packages:

```{r load_packages}
# Install required packages if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

if (!requireNamespace("Biostrings", quietly = TRUE))
  BiocManager::install("Biostrings")

if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load packages
library(Biostrings)  # For FASTA manipulation
library(tidyverse)   # For data manipulation

# Load custom functions from targseq package
# This package contains our specialized functions for maize analysis
library(targseq)
```

## 2. Reading Input Files
Before we begin, let's understand the input files we'll be working with:

```{r file_structure_input, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# This chunk will be evaluated when knitting
cat("tree_plotting/\n")
cat("├── hpc1_aligned.fasta              # Input: Multiple sequence alignment of the hpc1 gene\n")
cat("│                                    # Contains DNA sequences from multiple maize accessions\n")
cat("│                                    # Technical IDs as sequence headers\n")
cat("│                                    # ~3000 bp per sequence\n")
cat("│                                    # Aligned using MAFFT\n")
cat("│\n")
cat("└── seqid_label.csv                 # Input: Metadata mapping file\n")
cat("                                     # Links technical sequence IDs to meaningful labels\n")
cat("                                     # Contains columns: seqid, label_1, label_2, label_3\n")
cat("                                     # Includes ancestry information (founder_ancestry)\n")
cat("                                     # Classifies samples as 'Donor' or 'Recurrent'\n")
cat("                                     # Contains variant information (A204T, I211V)\n")
```

Now, let's set up our directory structure and read our input files:

```{r read_inputs}
# Create a project directory if it doesn't exist
project_dir <- "~/Desktop/tree_plotting"
if (!dir.exists(project_dir)) {
  dir.create(project_dir)
}

# Set file paths within the project directory
aln_file <- file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_aligned.fasta")
metadata_file <- file.path(project_dir, "seqid_label.csv")

# Read the mapping table with taxonomic metadata
metadata <- read.csv(metadata_file)

# Display the first few rows to understand the structure
head(metadata)

# Read the FASTA alignment using Biostrings
original_alignment <- readDNAStringSet(aln_file)

# View information about the alignment
cat("Number of sequences:", length(original_alignment), "\n")
cat("Sequence length:", width(original_alignment)[1], "bp\n")

# Display the first few sequence names
head(names(original_alignment))
```

## 3. Creating the Name Mapping Table

Now we'll prepare our sequence names and map them to meaningful labels:

```{r create_mapping}
# Extract sequence IDs from the alignment and remove description fields
seq_ids <- names(original_alignment)
trimmed_ids <- gsub("\\s.*", "", seq_ids, perl=TRUE)

# Verify sequence ID counts match
cat("Original sequence count:", length(original_alignment), "\n")
cat("Trimmed IDs count:", length(trimmed_ids), "\n")

# Assign the trimmed IDs to the alignment object
names(original_alignment) <- trimmed_ids

# Create a mapping dataframe that connects sequence IDs with taxonomic labels
# We also keep track of the original order in the alignment
name_map <- data.frame(seqid = trimmed_ids) %>%
  mutate(aln_order = row_number()) %>%
  inner_join(metadata)

# Filter to include only sequences that exist in our alignment
name_map <- name_map %>%
  dplyr::filter(seqid %in% names(original_alignment)) %>%
  rename(ancestry_call = "founder_ancestry")
rownames(name_map) <- name_map$label_3

# Report on mapping success
cat("Sequences successfully mapped:", nrow(name_map), "\n")

# Filter the alignment to keep only sequences we have metadata for
filtered_alignment <- original_alignment[name_map$seqid]

# Now replace the technical IDs with meaningful labels from label_3 column
names(filtered_alignment) <- name_map$label_3

# Store counts for later use
n_taxa <- length(filtered_alignment)
n_pos <- width(filtered_alignment)[1]

# Examine our newly labeled sequences
head(names(filtered_alignment))
```

## 4. Trimming the Alignment

Next, we'll trim the alignment to focus on the region of interest:

```{r trim_alignment}
# Load GenomicRanges for efficient sequence manipulation
library(GenomicRanges)

# Define trimming ranges (starting from position 2226 to the end)
trimmedRanges <- GRanges(
  seqnames = names(filtered_alignment),
  ranges = IRanges(
    start = rep(2226, n_taxa),
    end = rep(n_pos, n_taxa)
  )
)

# Perform the trimming operation
trimmed_alignment <- filtered_alignment[trimmedRanges]

# Verify the trimmed alignment
cat("Trimmed alignment length:", width(trimmed_alignment)[1], "bp\n")
head(names(trimmed_alignment))

# Writing the Processed Alignment to a New File
# Define output file path
output_alignment <- file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_nice_labels.fasta")

# Write the renamed alignment to a new file
writeXStringSet(trimmed_alignment, output_alignment, format="fasta")
cat("Renamed alignment written to:", output_alignment, "\n")
```

## 5. Extracting Variant Information

Now we can extract information for both variants using our specialized function from the targseq package:

```{r extract_variants}
# Define our variants of interest with their patterns
variants <- data.frame(
  name = c("A204T","I211V"),
  pattern = c("GCCGTGGCGTGGCGC", "ATCACCCGC")
)

# Extract variant genotypes using our custom function
# get_variant_gt is a function from the targseq package that identifies 
# genotype at specific positions based on surrounding sequence patterns
variant_data <- get_variant_gt(variants, trimmed_alignment)

# Convert variant calls to standardized REF/ALT format
# This makes visualization more consistent
variant_data$A204T <- c("ALT", "REF")[as.factor(variant_data$A204T)]
variant_data$I211V <- c("REF", "ALT")[as.factor(variant_data$I211V)]

# Ensure row names match the sequence names for proper mapping
rownames(variant_data) <- names(trimmed_alignment)
```

## 6. Building a Phylogenetic Tree

Now we'll build and visualize a phylogenetic tree from our processed alignment:

```{r build_tree}
# Load packages for phylogenetic analysis
library(ape)        # Basic phylogenetics functions
library(phangorn)   # Advanced phylogenetics 
library(phytools)   # Additional tree utilities

# Read the renamed alignment for phylogenetic analysis
hpc1_aln <- read.dna(output_alignment, format="fasta")

# Check labels in the alignment
labels(hpc1_aln)

# Convert to phangorn's phyDat format for phylogenetic analysis
hpc1_phyDat <- phyDat(hpc1_aln, type = "DNA", levels = NULL)

# Calculate distance matrix using JC69 model
# Note: You could use modelTest() to find the best model for your data
# mt <- modelTest(hpc1_phyDat)
dna_dist <- dist.ml(hpc1_phyDat, model="JC69")

# Build UPGMA tree and ladderize it for better visualization
hpc1_UPGMA <- ladderize(upgma(dna_dist), right = FALSE)

# Simple plot to check the tree
plot(hpc1_UPGMA, cex = 0.7, main = "UPGMA Tree Before Rotation")
```

## 7. Visualizing the Full Tree with ggtree

Now we'll create comprehensive tree visualizations with variant information using ggtree. This approach provides more flexibility and better integration of multiple data types compared to base R plotting:

```{r ggtree_setup}
# Install required packages if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

if (!requireNamespace("ggtree", quietly = TRUE))
  BiocManager::install("ggtree")

if (!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("ggplot2")

if (!requireNamespace("ggnewscale", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("ggnewscale")

# Load packages
library(ggtree)     # For tree visualization
library(ggplot2)    # For plotting
library(ggnewscale) # For multiple color scales in the same plot
library(dplyr)      # For data manipulation
```

Now let's apply our rotation function and create plots using ggtree:

```{r ggtree_full_visualization}
# Rotate the tree to put B73 reference at the top using our custom function
# pivot_on is a function from the targseq package that rotates the tree 
# so a specific taxon appears at the top
out_tree <- pivot_on(hpc1_UPGMA, hpc1_UPGMA$tip.label[1]) 

# Save the full phylogenetic tree for future use
tree_file <- file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_UPGMA.tre")
write.tree(out_tree, file = tree_file)
cat("Full phylogenetic tree saved to:", tree_file, "\n")

# Extract ancestry information for visualization
taxa_info <- name_map[out_tree$tip.label, ] %>%
  dplyr::select(label=label_3, ancestry_call)

# Create tree visualization with variant heatmap
# create_variant_heatmap_tree is our custom function from plotting_functions.R
# It creates a publication-quality tree with a variant heatmap
tree_plot <- create_variant_heatmap_tree(
  tree = out_tree, 
  data = variant_data
)

# Define color palette for ancestry information
pal <- c("Recurrent" = "tomato", "Donor" = "royalblue")

# Add ancestry information to the tree plot
# The %<+% operator from ggtree adds external data to the tree
tree_plot <- tree_plot %<+% taxa_info +
  # Add colored points indicating ancestry
  geom_tippoint(aes(color = ancestry_call), 
                position = position_nudge(x = 0.0015)) +
  # Set color scheme for ancestry points
  scale_color_manual(values = pal) +
  # Position the legend
  theme(legend.position = c(0.25, 0.5))

# Save the tree plot
ggsave(tree_plot, 
       file = file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_all_samples_tre.pdf"), 
       height = 12, width = 7, units = "in")

# Create a combined visualization with tree + alignment
# msaplot adds the multiple sequence alignment alongside the tree
p2 <- msaplot(tree_plot, 
              fasta = output_alignment, 
              offset = 0.05,  # Space between tree and alignment
              width = 0.6) +  # Width of alignment panel
  theme(legend.position = c(0.25, 0.5))

# Save the tree with alignment visualization
ggsave(p2, file = file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_tree_alignment.png"), 
       height = 12, width = 7, units = "in")
```

## 8. Subsetting and Visualizing Donor Taxa with ggtree

Now we'll create a subset analysis focusing only on taxa with donor ancestry plus the B73 reference:

```{r ggtree_subset_visualization}
# First, identify B73 in our dataset
b73_label <- grep("B73", name_map$label_2, value = TRUE)[1]
cat("B73 reference identified as:", b73_label, "\n")

# Create a subset of taxa with donor ancestry plus B73
donor_subset <- name_map %>%
  filter(ancestry_call == "Donor" | label_2 == b73_label)

# Check how many taxa we have in our subset
cat("Number of taxa in donor subset:", nrow(donor_subset), "\n")

# Extract the subset of sequences from our alignment
donor_alignment <- trimmed_alignment[donor_subset$label_3]

# Write the subset alignment to a file
donor_alignment_file <- file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_donor_subset.fasta")
writeXStringSet(donor_alignment, donor_alignment_file, format="fasta")
cat("Donor subset alignment written to:", donor_alignment_file, "\n")

# Build a new tree for the donor subset
donor_aln <- read.dna(donor_alignment_file, format="fasta")
donor_phyDat <- phyDat(donor_aln, type = "DNA", levels = NULL)
donor_dist <- dist.ml(donor_phyDat, model="JC69")
donor_UPGMA <- ladderize(upgma(donor_dist), right = FALSE)

# Get B73 label for rotation
b73_label <- names(donor_alignment)[1]

# Rotate the donor tree to put B73 at the top
donor_tree <- pivot_on(donor_UPGMA, b73_label) 

# Save the donor subset tree
donor_tree_file <- file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_donor_subset.tre")
write.tree(donor_tree, file = donor_tree_file)
cat("Donor subset tree saved to:", donor_tree_file, "\n")

# Prepare ancestry information for visualization
taxa_info <- donor_subset[donor_tree$tip.label, ] %>%
  dplyr::select(label=label_3, ancestry_call)

# Create visualization for donor subset
# Reuse the same function from plotting_functions.R
tree_plot <- create_variant_heatmap_tree(
  tree = donor_tree, 
  data = variant_data[donor_tree$tip.label, ]
)

# Add ancestry information with the same color scheme
pal <- c("Recurrent" = "tomato", "Donor" = "royalblue")
tree_plot <- tree_plot %<+% taxa_info +
  geom_tippoint(aes(color = ancestry_call), 
                position = position_nudge(x = 0.0015)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = pal) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.25, 0.5))

# Save the donor subset tree visualization
ggsave(tree_plot, 
       file = file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_donor_subset_tre.pdf"), 
       height = 10, width = 7, units = "in")

# Create combined visualization with tree + alignment
p2 <- msaplot(tree_plot, 
              fasta = donor_alignment_file, 
              offset = 0.05, 
              width = 0.6) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.25, 0.5))

# Save the donor subset tree with alignment
ggsave(p2, 
       file = file.path(project_dir, "hpc1_donor_subset_tre.png"), 
       height = 10, width = 7, units = "in")
```
## 10. Project File Structure

Let's examine the complete file structure with all our inputs and outputs:

```{r file_structure, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# This chunk will be evaluated when knitting
cat("tree_plotting/\n")
cat("├── hpc1_aligned.fasta              # Input: Original alignment file\n")
cat("├── seqid_label.csv                 # Input: Metadata mapping file\n")
cat("├── hpc1_nice_labels.fasta          # Output: Alignment with renamed sequences\n")
cat("├── hpc1_donor_subset.fasta         # Output: Subset alignment with donor taxa + B73\n")
cat("├── hpc1_UPGMA.tre                  # Output: Full phylogenetic tree in Newick format\n")
cat("├── hpc1_donor_subset.tre           # Output: Donor subset tree in Newick format\n")
cat("├── hpc1_all_samples_tre.pdf        # Output: Full tree visualization with variant heatmap\n")
cat("├── hpc1_tree_alignment.png         # Output: Full tree with sequence alignment visualization\n")
cat("├── hpc1_donor_subset_tre.pdf       # Output: Donor subset tree with variant heatmap\n")
cat("├── hpc1_donor_subset_tre.png       # Output: Donor subset tree with alignment\n")
cat("└── hpc1_circular_tree.pdf          # Output: Circular tree visualization\n")
```

## 11. Advantages of ggtree Over Base R Plotting

The ggtree package offers several advantages over base R plotting functions for phylogenetic trees:

1. **Grammar of Graphics Approach**: Uses the familiar ggplot2 syntax for consistent and extensible visualizations.

2. **Layered Visualizations**: Easily add multiple data layers (geom_tippoint, geom_hilight, etc.) to the tree.

3. **Multiple Tree Layouts**: Supports rectangular, circular, fan, and other tree layouts without rewriting code.

4. **Integration with Other Data**: The `%<+%` operator makes it easy to map external data onto the tree.

5. **Publication-Ready Figures**: Creates high-quality vector graphics with customizable aesthetics.

6. **Highlighting and Annotation**: Easily highlight specific clades or nodes of interest.

7. **Multiple Output Formats**: Compatible with all ggplot2 output formats (PDF, PNG, SVG, etc.).

8. **Heatmap Integration**: The gheatmap function allows easy addition of heatmaps alongside trees.

## 12. Understanding the Key Functions

Let's briefly review the key functions from our package that were used in this workflow:

### 1. Variant Detection Function
The `get_variant_gt()` function identifies variant positions in DNA sequences by:
- Scanning for specific sequence patterns around known variant sites
- Extracting the nucleotide at the variant position
- Converting the calls to a standardized format (REF/ALT)

### 2. Tree Rotation Function
The `pivot_on()` function rotates a phylogenetic tree to position a specific taxon at the top by:
- Finding the node corresponding to the specified taxon
- Re-rooting the tree at that node with a branch length of 0
- Preserving the original tree topology and branch lengths

### 3. Tree Visualization Function
The `create_variant_heatmap_tree()` function creates publication-quality tree visualizations by:
- Building a basic tree using ggtree
- Adding a heatmap showing variant states for each taxon
- Customizing the appearance with consistent formatting
- Supporting additional data layers (like ancestry information)

## 13. Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to use our specialized functions with the ggtree package to create advanced visualizations of phylogenetic trees with variant and ancestry information. We created:

1. Full tree visualizations with nucleotide and REF/ALT variant coding
2. Subset analyses focusing on donor taxa plus the B73 reference

3. Integrated heatmaps for variant visualization

These visualizations help reveal patterns of ancestry and genetic variation that would be difficult to detect through other means.

## 14. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing data issues**: Use the `%<+%` operator from ggtree to properly map data to the tree tips.
- **Layout problems**: If the tree is too crowded, try adjusting the `width` and `height` parameters in `ggsave()`.
- **Label overlaps**: Use `geom_tiplab2()` with an appropriate `offset` value to prevent overlapping labels.
- **Color issues**: Define custom color palettes using `scale_color_manual()` or `scale_fill_manual()`.
- **Legend problems**: Adjust the legend position and box orientation with `theme()` options.
